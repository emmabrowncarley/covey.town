# Covey.Town - Merge

Covey.Town provides a virtual meeting space where different groups of people can have simultaneous video calls, 
allowing participants to drift between different conversations, just like in real life. Our group has implemented a version of 
Covey.Town where there is capabiltiy to merge rooms together. To test out this function read the steps below. 

Setup 
1. Follow the instructions in the [initial README](https://github.com/neu-se/covey.town/blob/master/README.md) to run the app locally
2. This involves both configuring and running both the backend and frontend 

Instructions 
1. At the homepage of Covey.Town you will need to create at least two different rooms. When creating the towns it is important to make sure that the __"mergeable?"__ checkbox is clicked. 
2. NOTE: you can select to make these town private, but if the town is private the townID should be saved so that you can find the town when creating a merge request 
3. Create a merge request with the __"Merge with Other Towns"__ button and enter all of the necessary information and configure the settings according to user discretion. 
4. The merge request will then be received and all users from both towns will be placed into the new merged town with the requesting town ID and town update password transfer to be the properties of the new merged town.
5. The towns have been merged successfully.
